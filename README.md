Task 2-Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM ‚úî

->The ultimate goal of this endeavor was to generate actionable insights that can inform investment decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities in the ever-changing landscape of the stock market.

Observations drawn from this :üìî

1Ô∏è‚É£ Historical stock price data, along with relevant financial indicators and market sentiment features, can be effectively utilized as inputs to train stacked LSTM models.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of stacked LSTM models by selecting and processing relevant input features that capture the underlying dynamics of the stock market.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stacked LSTM models demonstrate the potential to outperform traditional statistical methods and single-layer neural network architectures in terms of forecasting stock market trends.
